This repository contains implementations of landmark distributed systems papers and personal projects, all implemented in Go for its readability, robust garbage collection/memory safety, and strong career prospects.

## Current Implementations
- **MapReduce**: Implementation based on the original paper, including map and reduce functions for distributed grep and word-count.

## Upcoming Plans
- [ ] Implement Raft consensus algorithm.
- [ ] Develop a sharded key-value service.
- [ ] Build a distributed fault-tolerant discussions forum optimized for scalability.
